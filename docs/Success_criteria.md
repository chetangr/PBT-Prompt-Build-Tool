# ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria and Metrics

## Overview

This document defines the success criteria for PBT implementations, including key performance indicators (KPIs), quality metrics, and evaluation methods.

## Core Success Metrics

### 1. Prompt Quality Metrics

#### Accuracy Score (0-10)
```yaml
accuracy_criteria:
  definition: "How well the prompt produces correct outputs"
  measurement:
    - Test case pass rate
    - Human evaluation scores
    - Automated validation results
  thresholds:
    excellent: ">= 9.0"
    good: ">= 8.0"
    acceptable: ">= 7.0"
    needs_improvement: "< 7.0"
```

#### Consistency Score (0-10)
```yaml
consistency_criteria:
  definition: "Stability of outputs across multiple runs"
  measurement:
    - Standard deviation of outputs
    - Similarity scores between runs
    - Deterministic behavior rate
  calculation: |
    consistency = 1 - (std_dev / mean_score)
  thresholds:

    acceptable: ">= 0.85"
```

#### Efficiency Score (0-10)
```yaml
